# HLT_Portfolio for CS 4395
Spring 2023

This is a Natural Language Processing portfolio for all the work I completed during the semester.
It contains several programs that were written from the scratch and were a great learning opportunity.

Several libraries were used in these program. Some of them are: Spacy, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Matplotlib, beautiful soup, among others.
Different machine learning and natural language processing techniques were also used. Some of them are: TF-IDF, IDF, Navie Bayes, CNN, RNN, Uni/Bi-grams etc.
