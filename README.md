# HLT_Portfolio for CS 4395
Spring 2023

This is a Natural Language Processing portfolio for all the work I completed during the semester.
It contains several programs that were written from the scratch and were a great learning opportunity.

Several libraries were used in these program. Some of them are: Spacy, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Matplotlib, beautiful soup, among others.
Different machine learning and natural language processing techniques were also used. Some of them are: TF-IDF, IDF, Navie Bayes, CNN, RNN, Uni/Bi-grams etc.
This class also helped me polish my soft skills. I completed most of the project by myself; however, with the chatbot project, I collaborated with my class fellow to create a chatbot using NLP. This project was one of the best learning experience by far. Building an entirely new project was exhaustive, but with some time management and priortizing work helped me the most.

## Summary
After taking this class, I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and skills. This class my first real introduction to the python language. Futhermore, I went from knowing nothing about the natural language processing to building some of amzaing projects (Web Crawler). I intend to keep on learning and enhancing my skills in this wonderful field of computer science and perhaps, one day working on some enterperise-level projects directly related to it.
