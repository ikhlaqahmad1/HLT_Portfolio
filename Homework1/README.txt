Overview:

The program takes a csv file path and name for system argument which contain last name, first name, middle initial, ID number, and phone number respectively. The program treats the file as a user input and validates the input formats for the fields mentioned above. As in case of an invalid format, the program prompts user to correct it via user input. Finally, it dumps everything as a pickle file

Run:
	
Simply add the path with the file name to system argument. For example, homework_ixa190000.py file.csv

Weakness/Strength of python:

Python is although a great language; however, it is very slow and error prone due to weak type declaration. On the other hand, it is very much like human language with extra rules and regulations which makes it very much readable.

Reflection:

It was my very first experience with program coding in python. I/O operations with extensive libraries are a tremendous help.
