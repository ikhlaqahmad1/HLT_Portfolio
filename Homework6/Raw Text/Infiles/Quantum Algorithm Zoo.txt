This is a comprehensive catalog of quantum algorithms. If you notice any errors or 
omissions, please email me at  
. 
Your help is appreciated and will be acknowledged.If there exists a positive constant \( \alpha \)
such that the runtime \( C(n) \) of the best known classical algorithm and the runtime
\( Q(n) \) of the quantum algorithm satisfy \( C = 2^{\Omega(Q^\alpha)} \)
then I call the speedup superpolynomial. Otherwise I call it polynomial. 
For a review of the \( O, \Omega, \Theta, \widetilde{O}, ... \) notations see the
Wikipedia article.
