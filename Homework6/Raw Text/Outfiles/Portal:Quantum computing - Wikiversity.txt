welcome to the quantum computing content development project where participants can create, organize and develop learning resources for quantum computing.quantum computers use quantum phenomena such as superposition and quantum entanglement to carry out operations on data. these computers do exist but use only a small number of qubits, on february 15th, 2007 w:d-wave systems, a leader in quantum computing technology, demonstrated its 16 qubit quantum computer. 16 qubits is not that fast, and is expensive and hard to maintain,  but research and technology in the area are growing at an incredible rate. in june of 2006 d-wave systems was excited about the 3 qubit system they had available. 6 months later they have a 16 qubit system operational.safeer e kashmir qau
